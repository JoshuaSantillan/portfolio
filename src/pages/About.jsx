            <p>Hi! I'm <span className="accent-3">Joshua Andrew</span></p>

            <p>I am currently <span className="accent-3">located in San Diego</span> where I obtained my Computer Science and Engineering degree from UC San Diego.</p>

            <p>I first <span className="accent-3">became interested in computers in 2001</span> when I was exposed to RuneScape Online. From an early age, I've been an avid web surfer and gamer, researching various topics and chatting with strangers around the world. <span className="accent-3">It's been interesting to watch the web transition</span> from the static web pages of Web 1.0, into to the rise of social media and shared content in Web 2.0, and now heading into a modern, more intelligent Web 3.0.</p>

            <p>My curiosity with <span className="accent-3">how the internet connects us together is what triggered my fascination in Computer Science</span>. I wanted to know how data was encrypted then sent over the wire and how to create secure systems that could talk to each other. My <span className="accent-3">interests in Computer Science</span> lie within the range of <span className="accent-3">Distributed Systems & Virtualization & Security</span>. My education had a deep focus in systems and networking and my research has allowed me to explore the world of distributed systems through container orchestration and deploying jobs geographically based on a set of unique paramaters.</p>

            <p> Outside of desk work and programming <span className="accent-3">I am a fan of playing video games such as Terraria, World of Warcraft and CS:GO.</span> I enjoy exploring nature and pretending that technology hasn't been invented yet, grabbing some boba (aka <span className="accent-3">taro milk tea</span> with <u>no</u> boba),
              listening to trance music, or fabricating never-before-seen memes. Fun fact: <span className="accent-3">I like turtles</span> üê¢.
