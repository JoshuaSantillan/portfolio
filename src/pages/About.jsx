            <p>Hello, my name is Joshua Andrew Santillan and I like turtles</p>
            <p>üê¢</p>
            <p>Hello! I'm Joshua Andrew, a UC San Diego Computer Science graduate fueled by curiosity and innovation with a goal to excel in the dynamic tech industry. With a solid academic foundation and hands-on experience in cutting-edge research projects, I am eager to start my career journey, contributing to the growth of technology and development.
            </p>
            <p>
              At UC San Diego, I was given the opportunity to tackle innovative research projects such as optimizing geographically distributed workloads and exploring the ever-growing realm of cloud data migration. The collection and analysis of power-grid data have contributed to more sustainable and eco-friendly data center operations across the globe. Working with technology for a carbon-aware system that efficiently deploys jobs geographically required us to use technologies such as Docker, Kubernetes, MQTT, RESTful API, and the National Research Platform (NRP).
            </p>
            <p>
              I am excited to join a company where I can continue to grow, acquire new skills, and contribute to a rapidly evolving industry. I am itching to jump on the train of cutting-edge technology and development, making a lasting impact on my career path. If you're looking for a highly motivated, curious, and eager-to-learn individual, I am the perfect candidate to join your team.</p>
