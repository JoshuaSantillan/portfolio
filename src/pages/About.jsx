            <p>Hi! My name is <span className="accent-3">Joshua</span> and I like turtles üê¢</p>

            <p>I'm 27 years old and currently <span className="accent-3">located in San Diego</span> where I obtained my computer science and engineering degree from UC San Diego.</p>

            <p>I first <span className="accent-3">became interested in computers in 2001</span> when I was exposed to RuneScape Online. From an early age, I've been an avid web surfer and gamer, researching various topics and chatting with strangers around the world. <span className="accent-3">It's been interesting to watch how the web has transitioned</span> from the static web pages of Web 1.0 to the rise of social media and shared content in Web 2.0, and now the current ongoing transition into a modern, more intelligent Web 3.0.</p>

            <p>My curiosity with <span className="accent-3">how the internet connects us together is what triggered my interest in Computer Science</span>. I wanted to know how data was encrypted then sent over the wire and how to create secure systems that could talk to each other. My <span className="accent-3">interests in Computer Science</span> lie within the range of <span className="accent-3">distributed systems, virtualization, and security</span>. My education had a deep focus in systems and networking and my research has allowed me to explore the world of distributed systems through container orchestration and deploying jobs based on unique paramaters.</p>

            <p> Outside of desk work and programming <span className="accent-3">I enjoy playing video games such as Terraria, World of Warcraft and CS:GO.</span> I like exploring nature and pretending that technology hasn't been invented yet, grabbing boba <span className="accent-3">(taro milk tea with no boba)</span>,
              listening to trance music, or fabricating never-before-seen memes... wait, don't you have to be at your computer for that?
